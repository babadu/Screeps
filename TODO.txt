SCREEPS TODO LIST

New features:

Testing Support:
1. Extend console.save to save to a file.
2. Add code to support test construction plans.

Game management:
1. Track time to level.
2. Can we use linear programming concepts to figure out the optimum path? [Advanced]

Resource management:
1. Increase creeps limits with level upgrades.
2. Add logic for creating extensions.
3. Do math formula to calculate creep limits.
	Consider distance to spawn from source, construction site from source, extension site from source.
4. Plan road construction on 2-3 sources. 
	Avoid construction over swamps etc.
	
Creep management:
1. Add road construction site list to the creep.
2. Calculate body parts for builders, upgraders.
	Level 1-2
	Harvester/Builder/Upgrader 				[WORK,CARRY,MOVE]
	Guard 									[ATTACK,TOUGH,TOUGH,MOVE]
	Level 3-4
	
3. After upgrading to level 2 switch role to harvester.

Defense management:
1. Add logic for creating and repairing walls.
2. Add logic for finding exits.

Bugs:

Refactoring:
1. Clearly define Memory objects and global variables.			...done
2. Clean up prototypes and methods.								...done
3. Create a library module.
4. Create a test module.
5. Clearly define initializer.									...done

Game Optimizations : 

1. Optimize role switch between harvester and builder.			...done
2. Build road from the Source back to the Spawn.
	--> Eliminate the time to go back and forth from the Source to the Spawn to deliver and use the energy.

3. Optimize role switch between a builder and a repairer.
4. Repair wall right away when build.

Performance Optimizations 
	Over a period of 2 hours, the system slows down as hell. Need to optimize to make this work.
